README file for TurboSight Linux drivers

NOTE: this document assumes that all prerequisite packages like kerner headers
and build tools are already installed in your Linux system.

Most of the steps require root access to and basic knowledge of Linux system.

Create directory, for example /root/tbs and copy the following file to it:

- linux-tbs-drivers.tar.bz2 (S2API Linix driver for TurboSight TBS 6921)

I.1 extract linux-tbs-drivers.tar.bz2 archive:

# tar xjvf linux-tbs-drivers.tar.bz2

I.2 go to driver package directory:

# cd linux-tbs-drivers

I.3 depending on your kernel version and if the kernel is x86 or 
x86_64 (check output of 'uname -a') do:

- for x86 kernel 3.x (x86 32 bit installations of kernel 3.x):

# ./v4l/tbs-x86_r3.sh

- for x86 kernel 2.6.x (x86 32 bit installations of kernel 2.6.x):

# ./v4l/tbs-x86.sh

- for any x86_64 kernel (x86 64 bit installations of Linux):

# ./v4l/tbs-x86_64.sh

I.4 build and install the driver:
# cd ..
# make && make install

I.5 reboot in order to load the newly installed driver:

# shutdown -r now

I.6 after reboot check that the newly installed driver is loaded correctly:

# dmesg | grep cx23885

if everything is OK, the output from the above command should be similar to:

cx23885 driver version 0.0.2 loaded
